title: An Improvement?
---
When considering the Apple Launcher screen we are forced to ask whether this experience is an improvement or not. Grouping is powerful in some situations. We like it here, but acknowledge that this is opinion.

### Pros
- Eliminates linear navigation redundancy.
- All visible information responds to Touch to Explore gestures.

### Cons
- Requires replicating all UIAccessibilityElement interactions.
