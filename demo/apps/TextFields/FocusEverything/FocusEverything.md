## Solution: Focus Everything

One solution is to behave like the Arrow Key on a keyboard. This means that all elements are individually focusable. This results in the following behavior:

1. **Swipe Right:** "Username"
2. **Swipe Right:** "Username, GnarlyDawg84"

Notice that you hear the word UserName twice. A small problem on a short form, but can be annoying to some in longer experiences.

This is the simplest solution, though it doesn't account for associating error messages and other information. Informational relationships are only identifiable via Focus Order and locality.
