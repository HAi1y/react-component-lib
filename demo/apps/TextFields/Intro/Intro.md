## Text Fields - Introduction

Text Field accessibility is complicated and WCAG lacks clear guidance. The web experience is simplified because of the way the web works:

1. Arrow keys move accessibility focus.
2. Tab keys move input focus.

This means that users can switch freely between more and less verbose input epxeriences simply by switching from right arrow to tab.

> VoiceOver users can only move Accessibility Focus. They must interact with a control to move Input Focus.

This forces Engineers and Accessibility Designers to pick which experience makes the most sense based on the design of the experience and their comfort level with customizng accessibility behaviors. These experiences and their pros and cons are outlined in this demonstration.
