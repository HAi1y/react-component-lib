title: Input Fields - Introduction
---
Functional programming languages associate information in user interfaces in a fundamentally different way than markup languages. Constructs like inheritance, delegation, and privacy are fundmaentally different than techniqes the web allows.

The input mechanisms available are also different. VoiceOver users lack a smooth way to change between moving Accessibility Focus and moving Input Focus. Mobile devices all have the additional consideration of the Touch to Explore experience.

This all influences both design and implementation in regards to WCAG compliance. Particularly in regards to the relationship between the following success criteria:

1. [WCAG 2.1 - 1.3.1 Info and Relationships](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/info-and-relationships.html)
2. [WCAG 2.1 - 1.3.2 Meaningful Sequence](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/meaningful-sequence.html)
3. [WCAG 2.1 - 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#name-role-value)
