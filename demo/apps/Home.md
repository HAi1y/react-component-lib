The iOS Accessibility Simulator allows you to experience assistive technologies on the iOS Platform without having to own an iOS device. It is a powerful empathy building tool that connects the user experience with the technical information needed to implement that experience.

Ways you can bring this tool to your teams:

1. Instructional content that builds empathy and understanding.
2. Document Design Systems with expressive annotations.
3. Bring informed dicussion to your teams across all disciplines.

It has also come in very handy in MobA11y's Goal of building completely automated Quality Assurance and User Experience testing processes that include consideration for users with disabilities.
