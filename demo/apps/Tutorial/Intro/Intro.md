The first step in getting started with VoiceOver is to practice moving focus around. Click the Right and Left arrows to move Accessibility Focus.

### Step 1: Swipe Right
VoiceOver takes over the screeen allowing users to interact with gestures. Swipe Right moves Accessibility Focus foward.

> Hit the Right Arrow until Next is focused.

The right arrow simulates a user swiping right in VoiceOver. The left arrow behaves similarly in the other direction.

### Step 2: Double Tap
When the Black Focus Rectangle is on a control we consider it to have Accessibility Focus. Double tapping the screen activates the default action of the element with Accessibility Focus.

> Activate to move to the next screen.

This is the same in VoiceOver as Double Tapping the screen.
