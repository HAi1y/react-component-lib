## Rotor - Headings
The Rotor is a tool that allows VoiceOver users to navigate the structure of an application in different ways. One of those is to explore by Heading. 

Use Heading Navigation to skip past this poorly structured transaction list.

### Step 1: Set Rotor to Headings
The current Rotor Setting changes what the Up and Down Arrows do. 

> Hit the Rotor Arrows until VoiceOver says Heading

Note: VoiceOver will default to Headings mode in most instances. 

### Step 2: Swipe Down
With the rotor in headings mode the Down gesture should move focus to the next Heading.

> With the Rotor set to Headings click the Down Arrow

Accessibility Focus should move straight to the Skip To Here heading.
